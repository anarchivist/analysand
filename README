Analysand - a terrible burden for a couch
-----------------------------------------

Analysand is a CouchDB client library of dubious worth.  It was extracted from
https://github.com/amvorg-underground/catalog.

Features:

* GET, PUT, DELETE on databases
* GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD on documents
* GET on views
* POST /_session
* Celluloid::IO-based change feed watchers
* Cookie and HTTP Basic authentication for all of the above


Developing Analysand
--------------------

You'll need a CouchDB >= 1.1.0 instance.  I recommend not using a CouchDB
instance that you're using for anything else; Analysand requires the presence
of specific admin and non-admin users for its test suite.

See spec/support/test_parameters.rb for usernames, passwords, and connection
information.
