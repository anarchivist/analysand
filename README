Analysand - a terrible burden for a couch
-----------------------------------------

Analysand is a CouchDB client library of dubious worth.  It was extracted from
https://github.com/amvorg-underground/catalog.

Analysand was written for Ruby 1.9.  It is known to work on Ruby 1.9.3-p194 and
Rubinius 2.0.0.

Features:

* GET, PUT, DELETE on databases
* GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, COPY on documents
* GET, PUT on document attachments
* GET, POST on views
* POST /_session
* POST /_bulk_docs
* Celluloid::IO-based change feed watchers
* Cookie and HTTP Basic authentication for all of the above
* Database objects can be safely shared across threads

Developing Analysand
--------------------

You'll need a CouchDB >= 1.1.0 instance.  I recommend not using a CouchDB
instance that you're using for anything else; Analysand requires the presence
of specific admin and non-admin users for its test suite.

See spec/support/test_parameters.rb for usernames, passwords, and connection
information.

Naturally, we hang with all the cool kids:

* Travis CI: http://travis-ci.org/#!/yipdw/analysand
* Code Climate: https://codeclimate.com/github/yipdw/analysand
* Gemnasium: https://gemnasium.com/yipdw/analysand
